## README


This repository contains the code and data used to generate the results and some of the figures for the paper:

Yuri Shendryk, Jeremy Sofonia, Robert Garrard, Yannik Rist, Danielle Skocaj, and Peter Thorburn (2020). Fine-scale prediction of biomass and leaf nitrogen content in sugarcane using UAV LiDAR and multispectral imaging. <i>International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, Volume 92</i>, 102177, DOI: <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2020.102177'>10.1016/j.jag.2020.102177</a>



The notebook contains a section in which we compare the predictions of our model to an independent data set collected by Sugar Research Australia. We do not have permission to publish their data set, so the corresponding section of the notebook will not execute.


The environment used to run this code can be cloned from the `environment.yml` file.
